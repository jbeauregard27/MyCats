            <h1>Hi there! </h1>
            <h2> I'm Midnight, a sleek and mysterious six-year-old black cat. My humans say I'm quite the looker, though
                I
                think my true charm lies in my personality. I have something called,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_granuloma" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>eosinophilic granuloma complex</i></a>, which
                sounds fancy but mostly means I have to wear this annoying cone. Ugh, I hate it! In my house, I'm
                not alone.
                I have a few feline siblings: Sunshine, Evie, and Momo. Sunshine and I are siblings by blood, and
                she's got
                this golden fur that matches her name. She's a bit of a diva and sometimes picks on Evie, who’s more
                on the
                timid side. Evie tries to steer clear of Sunshine, but she’s sweet and gentle when we do cross
                paths. Momo,
                on the other hand, is a playful ball of energy, always trying to get us all involved in some new
                game or
                chase.

                One of my favorite memories is the time we all conspired to steal treats. It was Momo’s idea, of
                course. She
                spotted where the humans kept the treats and got Sunshine and me in on the plan. Evie was too scared
                to join
                in, but she watched from a safe distance. Momo created a diversion by knocking over a vase (don’t
                worry, it
                was already cracked), while Sunshine and I made a beeline for the treat cupboard. We managed to get
                it open
                and had a feast until the humans caught us. They couldn’t stay mad for long—we’re too adorable!

                Nap time is sacred in our house, especially for me. When I nap with my humans, they take off my
                cone, and
                it’s pure bliss. Sunshine often curls up at the foot of the bed, while Momo sprawls out wherever she
                pleases. Evie usually finds a quiet corner where she can feel safe. We may have our little
                squabbles, but at
                the end of the day, we’re a family. And for me, any day without the cone is a good day, especially
                if it
                includes bird-watching and a nice, long nap.
