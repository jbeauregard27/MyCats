            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <h2>I'm Sunshine, a six-year-old ginger cat with a flair for the dramatic. Like my brother Midnight,
                I have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eosinophilic_granuloma" target="_blank"
                    rel="noreferrer noopener"><i>eosinophilic granuloma complex</i></a>, but thankfully, I don't have to
                wear a cone. My past wasn’t easy;
                I spent a long time living outside before I found my forever home. Because of that, I’m a bit wary of
                the outdoors and prefer the safety and comfort of our cozy home.

                I have to admit, I'm not too fond of being around the other cats. They can be a bit much for me, but
                sometimes I love hanging out with Midnight. He is my brother after all. I much
                prefer the company of my mama and daddy. There's nothing better than curling up in their laps and
                soaking up all the love and attention they give me. My absolute favorite spot is the hammock upstairs.
                It's the perfect place for a nap, and I get a great view of the birds outside. Watching them flit around
                brings me a sense of peace and curiosity.

                One of my favorite memories is the first time I discovered the hammock. I was hesitant at first, but
                once I climbed up and felt how stable it was, I was hooked. Now, it's my go-to spot for relaxation. I
                can spend hours there, watching the birds and soaking up the sun. My humans often find me there,
                stretched out and content, with my wormies scattered around. I have a special talent for playing fetch
                with my wormies. I'll bring one to my mama or daddy, and they’ll throw it for me. I'll chase it down and
                bring it right back for another round.

                Even though I may come off as a bit of a loner, my heart is full when I’m with my humans. They’ve given
                me the home and love I never had, and for that, I’m endlessly grateful. My life now is a far cry from
                the uncertainty of the outdoors, and I wouldn't trade it for anything.
